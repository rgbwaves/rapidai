# RAPID AI — Action Catalog (ACT001–ACT008)
# Source of truth for maintenance actions and diagnosis mapping.

actions:
  ACT001:
    title: "Vibration re-measure (confirmation run)"
    justification: "Confirm trend before committing to intervention"
    verification: "Compare new RMS to previous within \u00b110%"
  ACT002:
    title: "Bearing lubrication / grease replenishment"
    justification: "High frequency or temperature rise indicates lubrication deficit"
    verification: "HF amplitude and temperature return to baseline within 24h"
  ACT003:
    title: "Alignment check (laser / dial indicator)"
    justification: "Axial dominance and coupling signature indicate misalignment"
    verification: "Alignment report within tolerance per OEM spec"
  ACT004:
    title: "Balance correction (single / dual plane)"
    justification: "1\u00d7 dominance with horizontal preference indicates imbalance"
    verification: "1\u00d7 amplitude reduced by \u226550% post-correction"
  ACT005:
    title: "Bearing replacement (scheduled)"
    justification: "BPFO/BPFI signatures with acceleration confirms bearing defect"
    verification: "Post-replacement vibration within acceptance limits"
  ACT006:
    title: "Foundation tightening / soft foot correction"
    justification: "V/H ratio and looseness indicate structural issues"
    verification: "Phase stability and reduced looseness harmonics"
  ACT007:
    title: "Process investigation (not machine fault)"
    justification: "Trend correlates with process variable, not machine degradation"
    verification: "Vibration returns to normal with process stabilisation"
  ACT008:
    title: "Emergency shutdown / trip recommendation"
    justification: "Critical SSI with accelerating trend, imminent failure risk"
    verification: "Machine isolated, inspection completed before restart"
